## Hackathon Pitch 

### Problem

In the past decade, consumerism has been consistently blamed by environmentalists as one of the main culprits of accelerated climate change.
As they say: "Love Fades...But Plastic Lasts Forever"

The awareness that everything we purchase comes with some environmental footprint has been campaigned fervently but there's been basically no resulting action from that.

### Solution

K-N-N-Soft (kang sheng nicholas and myself) want to be the one that drives those actions. These actions encompass: 
Sustainable Purchasing, 
Minimalism, 
and Environmental Activism, 
in small communities. Saving the planet with some good old kampung spirit.

Our app is centered around helping our users address these questions:

- Do I really need to buy this?
- If YES, how can I buy it sustainably?
- Does what I do have any impact?
- What is everyone else doing to contribute to society?

## Rentals

Lets begin with this scenario, I need a ladder to hang up some decorations tomorrow for diwali... must I really buy one? 
Every year we will go full Marie Kondo, throwing things that doesn't spark joy for us but what if we could spark this joy for another person? 
Throwing is not a sustainable solution to decluttering, renting is. 

Rental helps us as a society to be more sustainable, save space and save money. The current take-make-waste economy is not practical at all. 
We need to shift our mindset from paying for ownership of goods, to paying for access to goods.

This is where EcoLoremIpsum comes in. We aim to show the world that we as a society are ready to make a change. Nicholas will now show you the future

## Demo

EcoLoremIpsum focuses on living communities. 
It allows us ordinary folk to put items up for rental for others in our neighbourhood.
Like the ladder Nikhil mentioned earlier, I could buy one, use it for 5 minutes and then chuck it in my store room for the rest of eternity
OR I could place it on EcoLoremIpsum, loan it to someone and also help save the earth.

Let's see how easy it is to create a listing:
The person putting up the items will create a listing with an end date and a pick up location. 

#### Karma System

Actions on the app are rewarded with karma points, which is a merit system to regulate user behavior. 
Higher valued listings will be available to users with a higher karma.
Loan out more items, returning things on time in good condition and joining purchases all reward karma.

#### Bulk Purchasing 

In order to promote sustainable purchasing, we offer a marketplace focused mainly on everyday consumables ( toilet paper / soap / cleaning chemicals ... ) that will scrape the web for products that champion environmental or social benefits especially those that have been recognised with eco badges. These environmental attributes include ( recyclebility, energy efficiency and biodegradability ). By purchasing such products in bulk, members can reap both economic and environmental benefits at a communal level.

### Eco-Impact View

Rounding up the experience, members are presented with a dashboard ( for the stats-minded ) or a pictorial representation of their community's efforts ( simplified ). This feedback is valuable in fostering environmental awareness and satisfaction for their efforts.


### Integration with SP Business

The karma system could possibly tie up to the SP Utilities App's GreenUp feature. Actions can be validated and economic rewards can be given.
